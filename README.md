## Create a B-Tree Data Structure

This is a C program which reads a file containing one integer per line
and built a B-tree data structure for the input integers. After the 
B-tree is build the program traverses the tree and prints all the entries.
They should come out in ascending numerical order.

I use this to experiement with and understand B-trees. It doesn't actually
do anything useful but the logic could be the basis for some larger project
which uses B-trees.
